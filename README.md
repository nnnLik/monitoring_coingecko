# Coin Tracking Telegram Bot
This project creates a Telegram Bot that helps users keep track of their favorite cryptocurrencies and manage their portfolios. With this bot, you can:

## Features
1. Track the value of selected cryptocurrencies in real-time, against the dollar, euro, and ruble.
2. Add and remove coins from your personal portfolio, and keep track of its value.
3. Make simulated "purchases" of coins, using a specified amount of funds.
4. View predictions for the future value of selected coins, based on data analysis.
## Technical Details
The bot uses the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to retrieve real-time information about cryptocurrency prices and market trends. It also employs data analysis techniques to make predictions about future coin values. The bot is built using Python and the [aiogram](https://docs.aiogram.dev/en/latest/) library.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
2. Create a new bot on Telegram using the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) and obtain the API key.
3. Replace the placeholder API key in the code with the actual API key obtained from BotFather.
4. Run the bot using `python bot.py` and start using it on Telegram.
